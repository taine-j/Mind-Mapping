# Mind Mapping
I developed an application that leverages HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MongoDB for database management. This app integrates OpenAI's API to deliver AI-driven summaries of mind maps and generate AI nodes, enhancing brainstorming efforts.

## Lessons Learned:
This project advanced my full-stack web development skills and boosted my confidence in utilizing the OpenAI API. It also deepened my understanding of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, enhancing my overall web development proficiency.

## Possible Additions:
I plan to refactor this project using TypeScript to enrich my knowledge of the language further. Additionally, I'm interested in expanding the application's AI functionalities to explore new capabilities.
